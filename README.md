###JunitPerf-Ext

JunitPerf-Ext was created due to some missing functionality to JunitPerf. The two main issues with JunitPerf were extended by providing the following two custom classes:

* A timing class that provides line by line timings instead of the block only default timing in JunitPerf
* A reporting class for saving and reporting results where there is nothing but basic stdout in JunitPerf 

Also included in this package is a repeat test class to allow you to control how many times you can repeat a Junit Test as well as a general utilities class.
