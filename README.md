##JunitPerf-Ext

JunitPerf-Ext was created due to some missing functionality to JunitPerf. JunitPerf-Ext provides two custom classes:

* A timing class that provides line by line timings instead of the block only default timing in JunitPerf
* A reporting class for saving and reporting results where there is nothing but basic stdout in JunitPerf
